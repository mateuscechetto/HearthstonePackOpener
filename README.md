# HearthstonePackOpener

A python script for opening packs in Hearthstone

## Setup

You can install the executable [openPacks.exe](https://github.com/mateuscechetto/HearthstonePackOpener/raw/master/dist/openPacks.exe). Your Windows Defender may mark the archive as a malware but it's normal.

You can download the [project](https://github.com/mateuscechetto/HearthstonePackOpener/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip it.

For that, [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed and **Pynput** may have to be installed as well. 
```
pip install pynput
```

## Usage

For the executable you just need to double click it. 

For the project you run **openPacks.py**.

It will open a window asking how many packs you want to open, after typing the number of packs you go to hearthstone and it will open the packs automatically.

You need to:
* Have bought the packs
* Be in the Hearthstone open packs screen

**The time it takes to open a pack vary depending on your pc and the server you are playing on, so you might have to select a number slightly higher or smaller than the actual number of packs you are going to open.**

**You can't tab out of Hearthstone during the pack opening**
